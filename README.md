# typeFiction
An online platform for amateur writers to publish their stories.

## Project requirements
- Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
- Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
- In a README file (whose extension can be .txt, .md, .adoc, or .pdf) in your projectâ€™s main directory, include a full write-up describing your project, whatâ€™s contained in each file you created, why you made certain design decisions, and any other additional information the staff should know about your project. This document should be sufficiently thorough for your teaching fellow to run your project without any need to contact you further with questions. Take your time, and do not save this step for last.
- If youâ€™ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!


## To start the app
1. Setting.py + CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'
1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
1. Run `python3 manage.py makemigrations typeFiction` to make migrations for the typeFiction app.
1. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply migrations to your database.
1. Run `python3 manage.py runserver` to start server

## ðŸ”Š Plan and processes
This project started out as an extension of my [Network project](https://github.com/abeatrix/network). The goal of this project is to utilize the skills Iâ€™ve acquired from the last four projects to build something new, which includes making API calls, creating API routes, pagination, etc. However, instead of using SQLite, I have decided to use PostgreSQL as the database. 

I wanted to use React.js for the frontend initially but realized React.js would be better used when building a single-page application, that makes me believe staying with Django templates and focus on creating reusable components with jQuery would be a better choice here. I have also done my research on designing mobile-friendly web apps and other django libraries.

## File Structure
- finalproject: project directory with all the basic settings for the project
- typeFiction: app directory with all the app-related files
    - static/typefiction: static files for the app, including image files, styling files, and javascript files
    - templates/typefiction
        - components: folder that contains reusable component that includes JavaScript code for that specific component
        - normal template files

## Design Decisions
- Category is unique
- create reusable components / libraries that can be reused throughout the app
- JavaScript is includes within each component instead of in separated static folder because I want to take advantage of the django templates tags
