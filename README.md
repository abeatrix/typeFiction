## ðŸ”Š Plan and processes
This project started out as an extension of my [Network project](https://github.com/abeatrix/network). The goal of this project is to utilize the skills Iâ€™ve acquired from the last four projects to build something new, which includes making API calls, creating API routes, pagination, etc. However, instead of using SQLite, I have decided to use PostgreSQL as the database. 

I wanted to use React.js for the frontend initially but realized React.js would be better used when building a single-page application, that makes me believe staying with Django templates and focus on creating reusable components with jQuery would be a better choice here. I have also done my research on designing mobile-friendly web apps and other django libraries.
